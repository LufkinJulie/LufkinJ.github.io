			<strong>Personal Background:&nbsp;</strong>
			I was born and raised in Wakefield MA, I have lived in Sugarland TX, Shelby NC, New York NY, Federal Way WA and now Gastonia NC. 
			I have lived a few places over the years, my father's job as a hardware engineer took us to different parts of the county and my husband 
			was in the Army for 7 years.  I love hiking with my husband Alex and our Irish wolfhound mutt, Newton.

			I am a goofy person ( as you can tell from the photo I used) once you get know me but I am very shy in the beginning.
		</li>
		<li>	
			<strong>I'd Also Like to Share:&nbsp;</strong>
			Even though the classes I am taking this semester are what are required to graduate, 
			I am wicked excited about everything I am about to learn this semester.  Computer Programing is a complete change from my 
			retail/design background, it is  a very much needed and wanted change.  I hope all my questions (and there will be a lot) will not bother you guys.
